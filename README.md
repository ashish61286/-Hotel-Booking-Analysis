Hotel Booking Analysis

The data analysis of hotel booking shows various patterns and trends that provide insights into customer behavior and preferences. The data shows that Portugal accounts for the majority of cancellations. In general, City hotels charge more per person and per night than Resort hotels, with costs varied according to the season.

Groups and offline TA/TOs have higher cancellation rates than direct bookings, which have a lower cancellation rate. The number of visitors to city hotels increases throughout the year, with the spring and autumn experiencing the biggest numbers of visitors because of the highest prices.

Overall, the data analysis of hotel bookings provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. These findings can help hotel managers make informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and customer service to enhance guest satisfaction and maximize revenue.
